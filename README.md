# Customer Churn Analysis â€“ SQL Server & Power BI  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project analyzes **customer churn patterns** using **SQL Server** and **Power BI** to uncover key drivers behind customer attrition.  
The objective is to provide **actionable insights** for retention strategies and reduce churn in subscription-based businesses.  

The project follows an **end-to-end workflow**:  
1. **ETL in SQL Server** â€“ importing and staging raw customer data  
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation** â€“ handling nulls, duplicates, and standardizing categories  
3. **Power BI Modeling & DAX** â€“ creating calculated fields and KPIs  
4. **Dashboard Visualization** â€“ building an interactive churn analysis dashboard

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies  
- SQL Server â€“ ETL, data cleaning, transformations  
- Power BI â€“ Data modeling, DAX measures, visualization  
- Excel/CSV â€“ Raw dataset (~6,400 records)

## ðŸ“Š Key Features  
- **ETL Pipeline**: Loaded raw data into SQL Server, designed schema, created staging & clean tables  
- **Data Cleaning**: Standardized contract types, payment methods, and internet categories; removed duplicates & nulls  
- **Transformations**:  
  - Derived churn labels, age groups, and tenure ranges  
  - Built DAX measures for churn rate, retention, and service usage  
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Interactive reports segmented by demographics, geography, tenure, contracts, and services
